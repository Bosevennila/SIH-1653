## Problem Title :
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description :
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Problem Creater's Organization :
Ministry of Defence

## Idea :

    1. The proposed system is web-based that simulates a real life boardroom interview experience for both applicants and selectors.it integrates AI-driven question, automated response evaluation and real-time           scoring to ensure an unbiased and structured selection process.

    2. The platform dynamically adjusts question complexity based in the applicant's expertise and provides quantifiable assessment metrics for selectors to amke informed decisions.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram :

    The proposed solution consists of a web-based platform that facilitates an AI-assisted interview process for selectors and applicants. The system follows a structured approach:

### User Roles:
    1.Applicants: Register, complete profile, and participate in AI-driven or expert-led 
                  interviews.

    2.Selectors: Define selection criteria, monitor interviews, and review candidate scores.

### Interview Process:

    1.Begins with ice-breaking questions, followed by techno-managerial questions based on            the candidateâ€™s expertise.

    2.Questions are either expert-driven or AI-generated, ensuring relevance.

    3.Candidate responses are analyzed and scored based on correctness, relevance, and                confidence.

### System Components:

    1.Frontend: Provides an interactive UI for applicants and selectors.
    2.Backend: Manages data processing, scoring logic, and question bank.
    3.AI/ML Module: Assists in evaluating responses and ranking candidates.
    4.Database: Stores applicant profiles, interview records, and selection results.
    5.Final Selection & Reporting:
    6.System calculates final scores based on predefined criteria.
    7.Selectors receive a detailed performance report for each candidate.
